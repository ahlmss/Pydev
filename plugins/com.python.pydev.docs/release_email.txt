Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important**: PyDev requires Eclipse 3.8 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x (use LiClipse: http://www.liclipse.com for a PyDev standalone with all requirements bundled).

* **Preferences**

  * PyDev preferences may now be saved and persisted for each project or in the user settings (not just in the workspace).
  * Currently Save actions, Code Formatter, Typing and Imports are supported (more to come in upcoming releases).
  * The same pages in the preferences are used to save settings to (multiple) projects or user settings.
  * Configuration files are saved in Yaml format and are meant to be saved in version control.

* **Editor**

  * The option to apply auto-formating was changed to apply any save actions in non-workspace files.
  * Editor icon improved for dark theme (patch by Fathony Luthfillah).
  * When running the pep8 code analysis, the markers shown are no longer 1 character off.

* **Django**

  * Improved Django 1.7 support (patch by David Lehrian).

* **Profiling**

  * Integration with PyVmMonitor: http://pyvmmonitor.github.io/ (currently only available for backers of the effort).

    * A profiling view was created where the location of PyVmMonitor should be specified.
    * Just turning the option on will make all runs from that point on run with the selected profile backend enabled.

* **Debugger**

  * Connecting to subprocesses working in Python 3.4.
  * Attach to running process is now supported on Mac OS.

* **Others**

  * Unset VIRTUAL_ENV before running external Python to protect the sys.path (patch by James Blackburn).
  * pytest: Expected failure is no longer marked as a failure.
  * pytest: The working dir is changed so that conftests are loaded properly (to workaround issue in pytest: https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/pytest/issue/639/conftest-being-loaded-twice-giving).
  * Fixed issue where an unused import would not be properly removed if it was not a from import.
  * Fixed exception when drawing minimap overview ruler.
