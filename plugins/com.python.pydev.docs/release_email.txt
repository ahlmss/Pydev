Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important**: PyDev requires Eclipse 3.8 or 4.3 onwards and Java 7! For older versions, keep using PyDev 2.x (use LiClipse: http://www.liclipse.com for a PyDev standalone with all requirements bundled).

* **PyVmMonitor Integration**

	* PyVmMonitor: http://www.pyvmmonitor.com/ is now in public beta, so, the PyDev integration
		(Window > Show View > Other > PyDev > Profile) may be used to  profile your programs.

* **Debugger**

	* The debug view now has an interactive console (with history) attached to it by default (which may be toggled on/off). (PyDev-507)
	* Debugger no longer reopens a file when that file is already opened. (PyDev-456)
	* Handled issue when getting referrers for some object gave an error if it was found in a dict where the key is not a string.
	* When interactive console starts in debug session, a banner is no longer shown.
	* Stepping with #@DontTrace no longer returns through decorator call-site. (PyDev-526)
	* The default for tracing template render exceptions on Django is now false.

* **Interactive Console**

	* F2 to send contents from editor to console now considers backslash continuations. (PyDev-502)
	* Interactive Console interrupt now properly interrupts a sleep call (when possible). (PyDev-500)
	* PyDev interactive console now has a user-specified encoding (by default UTF-8). (PyDev-454)
	* Scroll the console on stdout / stderr output. (PyDev-504, patch by James Blackburn)
	* Moved interactive console initial commands to a separate preferences page.
	* Handling interrupted system call EINTR in the pydevconsole.py. (PyDev-534)
	* Fixed racing condition where the output of the console could appear as a user input. (PyDev-490, patch by James Blackburn)

* **Refactoring**

	* Fixed issue where indentation lost on rename module refactoring. (PyDev-498)
	* The rename modules refactoring wizard now provides a way to do a simple resource rename (to rename extensions).

* **Others**

	* Converting filename from .pyx to .py doesn't loose indexing on the file anymore. (PyDev-525)
	* The Cython parser now properly scopes methods.
	* Pasting contents directly in the PyDev package explorer to create a file uses the proper delimiter.
	* Fixed deadlock in ImageCache when rendering debug completions from console. (PyDev-527)
	* Fixed deadlock on racing condition when rendering PyTextHover. (PyDev-523)
	* Tab settings were separated from the editor color settings and may now be persisted in the project/user settings.
	* Fixed surround with try..finally/except indentation on Ctrl+1 when some line has a comment which has a different indentation.
