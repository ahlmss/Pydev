PyDev 5.1.2 Released

Release Highlights:
-------------------------------

* **Important** PyDev now requires Java 8 and Eclipse 4.5 onwards.

	* PyDev 4.5.5 is the last release supporting Java 7 and Eclipse 3.8.
	* See: http://www.pydev.org/update_sites/index.html for the update site of older versions of PyDev.
	* See: the **PyDev does not appear after install** section on http://www.pydev.org/download.html for help on using a Java 8 vm in Eclipse.

* The pytest integration was redone and should now work properly with the latest pytest.

* Properly showing output of tests in PyUnit view.
	* Improved dealing with items filtered through Ctrl+F9.
	* Better support for xdist (no longer reporting that the session finished when only a slave finished).
	* Reporting skipped items as "skip" and not "ok".
	* Properly showing running tests on PyUnit view.
	* Not using tokenize.open() in Python 3.2 for the execfile custom implementation.

* Expand and collapse keybindings changed to use the Numpad entries (so that they don't override the add/subtract used for zooming). #PyDev 695.

* The hover in PyDev has an implementation which is now more flexible and easier to extend in plugins (patch by Mark A. Leone).
